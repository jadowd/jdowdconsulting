10) How to make phpBB work in frame

  1. Go to Administer › Site configuration › phpBBforum settings

  phpBB display way:
    In the window
  X In frame inside Drupal page

  Save configuration

  2. Go to Administer › Site configuration > Performance
  Clear cached data
  
  3. Go to Administer › Site building > Menus > Navigation
  See Menu item with blank title in state (Disabled)
  You may enable it if you do not want phpbbforum in Primary links

  If you enable it your forum page will be with title.
  Reset will help to remove the page title if you disable it back.

  4. Go to Administer › Site building › Menus › Primary links
  Enter Menu item phpbbforum.

  Main page and link to phpBB in frame is

  phpbbforum

  To change this name you may add URL aliases (core module Path must be enabled).
  
  Add next URL aliases (System path -> URL Alias)
  
  For the path 'forums'
  
  phpbbforum -> forums
  phpbbforum/viewtopic.php -> forums/viewtopic.php
  phpbbforum/viewforum.php -> forums/viewforum.php
  phpbbforum/viewonline.php -> forums/viewonline.php
  phpbbforum/memberlist.php -> forums/memberlist.php  
  phpbbforum/posting.php -> forums/posting.php
  phpbbforum/search.php -> forums/search.php
  phpbbforum/ucp.php -> forums/ucp.php
  phpbbforum/mcp.php -> forums/mcp.php
  phpbbforum/faq.php -> forums/faq.php
  phpbbforum/report.php -> forums/report.php
  phpbbforum/adm/index.php -> forums/adm/index.php
  
  Administer › Site building › URL aliases › Add alias
  
  Existing system path: http://example.com/phpbbforum
  
  Specify the existing path you wish to alias. For example: node/28, forum/1, taxonomy/term/1+2.

  http://example.com/forums

  Specify an alternative path by which this data can be accessed. 
  For example, type "about" when writing an about page. 
  Use a relative path and don't add a trailing slash or the URL alias won't work.
  
  All links from blocks will have that path 'forums' instead of system phpbbforum.
  
  It works with or without Clean URLs enabled.
