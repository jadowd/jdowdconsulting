REQUIREMENTS
------------

BAWstats (betterAWstats as a Drupal module) requires Drupal 6 (from
beta 1 on) and betterAWstats (beta 1).  No other Drupal modules are
required.

A working AWstats system is needed with access to the AWstats data,
however, AWstats does not have to be operating as a CGI.

Administration privileges within Drupal are required to install the
module. For viewing statistics from multiple sites (in addition to the
default installed site) the ability to edit the Drupal site's
settings.php file is required.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. You can obtain the latest code for betterAWstats either from
tokyoahead.com or from the Drupal module repository.

2. Unzip (or Untar) the betterAWstats source under the chosen module
directory (e.g. sites/all/modules or under the modules directory of a
specific site).

3. As betterAWstats is designed as a stand alone CGI there are two
main requirements for converting it into a safe Drupal only module.

* Firstly, rename the directory from "betterawstats" to "bawstats"
(the Drupal module name).

* Secondly, remove or set permissions to unreadable the index.php file
that is the main CGI component of betterAWstats.  This prevents the
CGI component being run when you are using the code as a Drupal model.
The BAWstats module itself does not need this file.

4.  At this point the module should appear in the Drupal admin modules
page (the Drupal path /admin/build/modules).  It can be activated in
the usual Drupal way.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Before the BAWstats Drupal module can access the AWstats data, the
locations of the key AWstats directories must be configured.  Once the
BAWstats module is installed, it can be configured within the Drupal
administration pages (Drupal path /admin/settings/bawstats).

The module will not work without the correct locations of the four
required AWstats paths:

* AWstats data directory
  The directory containing the core AWstats data.  Within the AWstats
configuration it is the directory specified by the "DirData"
parameter.  The data must be accessible by php.

* AWstats library directory
  In the top level of a default AWstats install, this is the directory
wwwroot/cgi-bin/lib.  It's contents must be accessible by php.

* AWstats language directory
  In the top level of a default AWstats install, this is the directory
wwwroot/cgi-bin/lang.  Again it must be accessible by php.

* AWstats icon directory
  In the top level of a default AWstats install, this is the directory
wwwroot/icon.  IMPORTANT: This must be copied into the bawstats module
directory - e.g. copy the "icon" directory and all its contents into
the bawstats module directory.  NOTE, the "icon" directory is not the
same as the betterAWstats "icons" directory.
This is needed as the icons are referenced as URLs within the Drupal
tree.  The default value for this configuration option assumes the
icon directory has been copied.

Once configured correctly, betterAWstats statistics can be viewed in the
Drupal admin location admin/bawstats.


CUSTOMISING WHICH STATISTICS TO DISPLAY
---------------------------------------

AWstats can be configured to collect and store statistics for multiple
sites in it's data directory.

For privacy reasons, the BAWstats module will present and display
statistics only for the domain name of the site it is running in Drupal
under.  For example, if the BAWstats module is running on the Drupal
website http://www.example.com the module will look for AWstats data
files for "example.com" (AWstats drops the "www" by default).

If this is incorrect, for example, you wish the BAWstats module
running on site http://www.example.com to display some other AWstats
statistics (say, stats for another site, http://www.myexample.com),
the default can be overridden by editing the Drupal settings.php file
belonging to the www.example.com site. In the settings.php file, the
$conf['bawstats_defsite'] variable can be set to the site from which
to collect and display AWstats statistics.  For example:

$conf['bawstats_defsite'] = 'myexample.com';

would configure the bawstats module to look for and display AWstats
data for the domain myexample.com.

The reason this is not made configurable with the other configuration
settings above (i.e. via the Drupal admin pages) is that it may be
deemed inappropriate that site administrators for one site can configure
BAWstats to look at statistics for other sites.

One of the nice features of betterAWstats is its ability to show
statistics from multiple sites.  This is available in the Drupal
module, again, by editing the settings.php of the Drupal site for
which you want bawstats to have this ability.  Adding the following to
a settings.php file will allow bawstats to view ALL statistics
available in the AWstats data directory:

$conf['bawstats_admin_access'] = 1;


OTHER CUSTOMISATION
-------------------

Other configurations to the display of data can be made by directly
editing the betterAWstats config.php.


NOTICE
-------

This module uses one non-drupal CGI to render the world map of domain locations.
No data is revealed from this CGI (as it simply builds the map image from the
data it is given), but if this causes concern, it can be disabled by removing
access to the file modules/render_map.inc.php
