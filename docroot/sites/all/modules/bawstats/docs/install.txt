INSTALL PROCEDURE BETTERAWSTATS:

2. Edit the file config.php. Specially the paths to the awstats files have to be correct
3. Open index.php in your browser and you should see the results.
4. Under Linux, in order to use the online config editor, please make your config.php 
   file writable by apache:
    chown apache:apache ./config.php
    chmod 664 ./config.php
   and set $BAW_CONF['online_config'] to true.
   If your BetterAWStats installation is not protected by password, you have to make the 
   config.php file unwritable after you changed the settings and disable $BAW_CONF['online_config']

IMPORTANT NOTES:

It is STRONGLY recommended to password-protect the folder where BetterAWStats is installed
SPECIALLY when using the online config editor. You can use .htaccess files for example.

DAILY USE:

- update your statistics as usual with awstats
- Open BetterAwstats to see the statistics

HOW TO ADD ADITIONAL EXTRA SECTIONS:

Awstats allows to add aditional extra sections with custom stats. In order to create those,
1. Please edit the file /core/extras.inc.php. Take a look at section EXTRAS_1 and copy the whole function again into the file, changing the function to show the data desired.
2. Below that, please copy the $BAW_CONF_DIS_DEF section and edit the fariables according to point 1.
3. Copy the respective section also in config.php and adjust the values accordingly.
